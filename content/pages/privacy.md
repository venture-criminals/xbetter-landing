# Privacy Policy for XBetter

## Information Collection and Use
XBetter is designed to analyze tweets on your X (formerly Twitter) home feed. Here's what we collect and how we use it:

### Tweet Content
- We temporarily access tweet text that appears in your home feed
- This content is only processed locally in your browser
- No tweet content is stored permanently or transmitted to our servers

### API Keys
- If you choose to use the GPT-4o mini or other external AI models, you'll need to provide an API key
- Your API key is stored locally in your browser's storage
- The key is only used to communicate directly with the AI service
- The key is not saved or stored by us

### Browser Data Access
- We only access and operate on twitter.com/home and x.com/home pages
- We don't collect browsing history or data from any other websites
- Content scripts are limited to these specific URLs

### Storage
We store locally in your browser:
- Your selected filters
- AI model preference
- Extension enabled/disabled state
- API key (if provided)

This data never leaves your browser.

## Data Sharing and Security

### Third-Party Services
- When using GPT-4o mini or other external AI models, tweet text is sent directly to the AI service for analysis
- No personal information or Twitter account data is included in these requests
- Only tweets' text is sent to the AI service. No images, videos, other media or post authors are included
- We don't share any data with other third parties

### Security
- All operations happen locally in your browser
- Communication with AI services uses secure HTTPS connections
- API keys are stored securely in Chrome's local storage

## User Control and Rights
